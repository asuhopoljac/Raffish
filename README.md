Pre-README
-----------------------
Just know that since I am dumb and lazy, I didnt make a loopy-thingy or whatever to make the Nukebot spam (I know I sound professional dont I?), so instead I just copied and pasted a ton of lines, resulting in >1000 lines of code - dont blame me, not like your dumbass can do better... (Actually i think you can)

Installation or download or prep or whatever you want to f--king call it
-------------------------------
NOTE: This is for a linux machine, or atleast i think it is


Step 1: Have python installed - im not saying how

Step 2: git clone https://github.com/asuhopoljac/Raffish

Step 3: cd Raffish

Step 4: python3 raffish.py

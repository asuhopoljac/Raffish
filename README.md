to all the ladies and gents reading this, i take NO responsibility for any harm or damage caused by this, Raffish is a tool that was made for educational purposes only. \(>.<)/

Installation or download or prep or whatever you want to f--king call it
-------------------------------

Step 3: cd Raffish

Step 4: python3 raffish.py

yeah thats it, you glad i babysitted you through? dumbass...

Usage or how to turn on or commands or whatever
-----------------------------------------------------
what am i doing with my life

Basically, there a few fake moderation commands you can use to disguse this bot, its juts simple ones, like fake anti raid, fake server scan, and such - do $help to see them all and get a good explanation

As for the juicy nuking part, there are 4 nuking variants, they go as follows:

$nuke small (a small nuke)

$nuke big (obviously, a bigger nuke)

$nuke rape (this is a HUGE, and i mean HUGE nuke)

$nuke trashcan (this is about three times bigger the the rape nuke, but in addition, it creates channels, absolutely trashing the server in question)

$help nuke is a thing too


**IMPORTANT NOTE**

You can change what the nukes say in lines 12-15, you can edit the variables and that will be what the bot spams, making the changing the text being spammed much easier

Just to be a bit funny and annoy users, i made the bot say "yeah... nah." every time it detects someone that is not a bot say "yeah", you can change what the keyword it dectects is (on line 9 \ nine) and you can change what it replies when detected (line 6016 / six-thousand and sixteen).

Dont forget to add your token at the bottom 


(DM ME ON DISCORD FOR ENHANCED VERSION - shorter script, more features, channel deletes, faster response time & more cool shi)

enjoy chaos, and stay kawaii
